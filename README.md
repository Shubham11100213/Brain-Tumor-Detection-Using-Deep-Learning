# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

Welcome to the **Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning** project repository! This project presents a cutting-edge approach to automating the detection of brain tumors using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques. Developed under the academic guidance of **Mr. Praful Pandey (Assistant Professor)** at the **United Institute of Technology, Prayagraj**, this initiative is driven by the need for faster, more accurate, and scalable medical diagnostics.


## Project Highlights

- **Purpose-Driven Healthcare Innovation:** Focused on enhancing early detection of brain tumors to support timely medical intervention and improve patient outcomes.

- **Deep Learning Architecture:** Utilized **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **VGG16** through **Transfer Learning** to train models on MRI datasets for efficient tumor detection.

- **Comprehensive Image Analysis Pipeline:** Implemented a complete image processing workflow including **image segmentation, morphological operations, preprocessing, feature extraction**, and **classification**.

- **Agile Development Methodology:** Adopted an agile model encompassing requirement gathering, iterative development, testing, deployment, and continuous feedback integration.

- **Multiple MRI Modalities Supported:** The model is trained on a variety of MRI sequences including **T1-weighted, T2-weighted,** and **FLAIR** images to ensure robust and generalized performance.

- **Interactive System Design:** A user-friendly application allows users to upload MRI scans and receive instant predictions, while the admin dashboard enables dataset management and model training.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Jupyter Notebook
- **Development Tools:** Google Colab, Skimage, OpenCV
- **Machine Learning Models:** CNN, Transfer Learning (VGG16)
- **Deployment Environment:** Cloud-based system accessible via browsers across platforms (Windows/Linux/Android)
